## 🧬 Project Overview – All Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

The **All Cancer Classification** project is a machine learning-based solution designed to accurately classify different types of cancer based on patient diagnostic data. The objective was to build a robust predictive model capable of assisting early cancer detection and improving clinical decision-making.

This project involved end-to-end data handling — from preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment. The classifier was trained on labeled medical datasets and optimized to deliver high accuracy across multiple cancer categories.
